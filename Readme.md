## Sarri Complain Api
I'm a passionate Chelsea F.C supporter, so after being disappointed about how we lost to Arsenal F.C and 
Sarri's subsequent attack on the players. I decided building a RESTful API as my learning project to keep 
record of each complain Sarri makes. 

It uses JSON instead of a database to store the data which means the data stored is gone once the server is restarted

#### Getting Started
    1. git clone project_name
    2. cd project_name and run npm_install
